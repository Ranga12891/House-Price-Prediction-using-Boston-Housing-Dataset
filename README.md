**The aim of this assignment is to learn the application of machine learning algorithms to data sets. This involves learning what data means, how to handle data, training, cross validation, prediction, testing your model, etc.**

**All the code is written in a single python file. The python program accepts the data directory path as input where the train and test csv files reside. Note that the data directory will contain two files train.csv used to train your model and test.csv for which the output predictions are to be made. The output predictions get written to a file named output.csv. The output.csv file should have two comma separated columns [ID,Output].**
